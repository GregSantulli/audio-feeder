audio-feeder
============

The AudioFeeder class abstracts a buffered output pipe for uncompressed PCM
audio in the browser, supporting both the standard W3C Web Audio API and a
Flash-based fallback for IE 10/11.

AudioFeeder was written for the [ogv.js in-browser Ogg/WebM media player](https://github.com/brion/ogv.js),
and is suitable for use in custom audio and video playback.

## Updates

* ?? - ??
 * Refactoring code paths and build process
* 0.0.2 - 2016-03-27
 * Broken out from ogv.js, cleaning up to publish as npm module

## Installing with Bower

If bundling via Bower, add to your bower dependencies:

```
bower install audio-feeder
```

By default, files will go into the bower_components/audio-feeder directory.
You will need to manually load the AudioFeeder.js file, such as:

```
<script src="bower_components/audio-feeder/AudioFeeder.js"></script>
```

or else load it through some other bundling process.

Then follow the instructions in the 'Usage' section below. You will need
to ensure that dynamicaudio.swf is also packaged along with your bundled
JS output from browserify to support IE 10/11, and may need to manually
set the base path in the options to the AudioFeeder constructor.

## Installing with Browserify or Webpack

If bundling via Browserify or Webpack, add to your npm dependencies:

```
npm install audio-feeder
```

and in your using code, set up the class like so:

```
var AudioFeeder = require('audio-feeder');
```

Then follow the instructions in the 'Usage' section below. You will need
to ensure that dynamicaudio.swf is also packaged along with your bundled
JS output to support IE 10/11, and may need to manually set the base path
in the options to the AudioFeeder constructor.

## Usage

```
// Create a feeder object
var feeder = new AudioFeeder({
  // Supply the path to dynamicaudio.swf for IE 10/11 compatibility
  base: "/path/to/resources"
});

// Set up 2-channel stereo, 48 kHz sampling rate
feeder.init(2, 48000);

// Flash mode for IE 10/11 requires waiting.
feeder.waitUntilReady(function() {

  // Buffer some data before we start playback...
  //
  // Each channel gets its own 32-bit float array of samples;
  // this will be 0.25 seconds of silence at 2ch/48kHz.
  //
  // Note it's ok for each bufferData() call to have a different
  // number of samples, such as when working with a data format
  // with variable packet size (Vorbis).
  //
  feeder.bufferData([
    new Float32Array(12000),
    new Float32Array(12000)
  ]);

  // Start playback...
  feeder.start();

  document.querySelector('button.stop').addEventListener('click', function() {
    // You can pause output at any time:
    feeder.stop();
  });

  // Optional callback when the buffered data runs out!
  feeder.onstarved = function() {
    // We don't have more data, so we'll just close out here.
    feeder.close();

    // Beware this may be a performance-sensitive callback; it's recommended
    // to do expensive decoding or audio generation in a worker thread and
    // pass it through for buffering rather than doing on-demand decoding.
  };
});
```

See also the included demo.html file for a live sample web page.

## Options  

* audioContext: an AudioContext object to be use instead of creating a new one
* base: base path containing dynamicaudio.swf for IE 10/11 Flash fallback

## Data format

AudioFeeder works with 32-bit floating point PCM audio. Data packets are
represented as an array containing a separate Float32Array for each channel.

## Status and audio/video synchronization

Playback state including the current playback position in seconds can be
retrieved from the getPlaybackState() method:

```
{
  playbackPosition: Float /* seconds of sample data that have played back so far */,
  samplesQueued: Float /* samples remaining before the buffer empties out, approximate */,
  dropped: Integer /* count of buffer underrun events */,
  delayed: Float /* total seconds of silence played to cover underruns */
}
```

Warning: this structure may change before 1.0.

playbackPosition tracks the time via actual samples output, corrected for drops
and underruns. This value is suitable for use in scheduling output of synchronized
video frames.

## Events

There is currently only one supported event, the 'onstarved' property.
This is called if available buffered data runs out during playback.

Todo:
* add events for beginning of playback?
* add event for reaching a threshold near starvation
* add event for scheduled end of playback
* fix event callback with Flash backend

## Flash and Internet Explorer 10/11

Internet Explorer 10/11 do not support Web Audio but do bundle the Flash
player plugin on Windows 8/8.1. This is automatically used if detected
available.

Beware that the dynamicaudio.swf file must be made available for the Flash
fallback to work!

Flash output is resampled to 2-channel 44.1 kHz, which is the only supported
output format for dynamically generated audio in Flash.

## Rebuilding Flash shim

The Flash shim can be rebuilt from source using the Apache Flex SDK.
The Makefile in this project fetches a local copy of the SDK, which
is not conveniently packaged.

Build prerequisites:

* bash / make / etc
* java
* ant
* curl

```
# Rebuild dynamicaudio.swf, installing Flex SDK if necessary
make
```

Be warned that downloading libraries for the Apache Flex SDK may prompt
you for permission at your terminal!

```
# To remove just the dynamicaudio.swf
make clean

# To remove the Flex SDK
make distclean
```
